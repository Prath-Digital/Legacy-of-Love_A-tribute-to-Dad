# Legacy of Love — A Tribute to Dad ❤️🌟

A tasteful, single-page tribute site built with React, TypeScript and Vite. This project collects memories, timelines, and visuals to honor a life and share moments with family and friends. It emphasizes accessible, responsive UI and gentle animations for a warm presentation. 🎞️📸

## Key Features ✨

- Elegant timeline presentation (`JourneyTimeline.tsx`) 🕰️
- Memories gallery and parallax sections (`MemoriesSection.tsx`, `ParallaxSection.tsx`) 🖼️🌄
- Countdown component for special dates (`Countdown.tsx`) ⏳
- Subtle animated particles/backgrounds (`FloatingParticles.tsx`) ✨
- Lightweight, fast build with Vite ⚡

## Tech stack 🛠️

- React + TypeScript
- Vite (dev server, build, preview)
- framer-motion (animations)
- lucide-react (icons)

## Repository layout 📁

- `index.tsx` / `App.tsx` — application entry and root layout
- `components/` — reusable UI components
- `MEMORIES_DATA/` — content, images, and data used by the site
- `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts` — project tooling and configuration

## Requirements ✅

- Node.js 18 or newer (recommended)
- npm (or Yarn) installed

## Quick start — Development 🚀

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit the local URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) to view the site.

## Build & Preview — Production 🏁

Generate an optimized production build and preview it locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deployment suggestions 📦

- Deploy the production build to Vercel, Netlify, or Surge for quick hosting. Both Vercel and Netlify support automatic deploys from GitHub with zero-config for Vite sites. 🌐

## Customizing content ✍️

- Add or edit memory items under `MEMORIES_DATA/`. Images and content placed there will be rendered by the site components.
- Component locations: see `components/` for UI behavior and animation controls.
